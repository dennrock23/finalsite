    <p> Rad Records is a very relaxed, fun, and enjoyable place to work. We try not to put too much pressure and stress on our employees, but at the same time, we want somebody who will fulfill the tasks that their job requires in a satisfactory manner, and does not need constant reminders. However, these tasks are generally not super difficult and you have plenty of relaxation time in between.</p>
    <p> In addition, it is preferred (but not required) that you be a music/pop culture fan, as this is the merchandise our store specializes in, and customers often ask for knowledgable recommendations regarding this subject.</p>
    <p> Also, great social and customer service skills are a must. You must be friendly, fun, and helpful. </p>
    <p> You must also have reliable transportation to and from work, and alcohol or drug usage cannot interfere with your ability to function on the job. If this seems like an opportunity you would be interested in, please email your resume and a quick message saying who you are to <b>radrecordsjobs@gmail.com</b>. We look forward to having you join the Rad Records team. </p>
