                    <p> Rad Records was founded in 1995 by Dennis Bereznyak in Northeast Philadelphia. We have a wide variety of products that are sure to interest any fan of music, movies, or entertainment. We have a mom and pop atmosphere in our store, so you know that when you come in you will be taken care of. </p>
                <p>
                    We have several sections throughout the store, such as a vinyls section, a CDs section, and a merchandise section. These are just a couple of sections that we have available, and you are sure to find a bunch of others that will interest you if you take the time to come in. </p>
                <p> Occasionally, we also host concerts for small bands in our back room. We will post upcoming shows on Facebook, so you will know when to come. If you are in a band and would like to book a show, you can contact us on our Facebook page and give us some information about your band and we can discuss the logistics. </p>
                <p>Overall, we are a very customer-oriented small business and if you come in, we guarantee that you will find everything you need, and not only that, but you will also love the atmosphere and be treated with nothing but respect. In fact, most customers quickly become friends with our employees, because they treat you like their own personal friends. Just come on in, and give Rad Records a try! </p>
