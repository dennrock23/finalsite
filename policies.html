                    <p> Here at Rad Records we try to be as laid back and understanding as possible, but we do have a few policies that customers must follow. </p>
                <p> 1. Customer must always rewind rental cassettes and VHS tapes.</p>
                <p>  2. Rental period lasts 2 weeks. If you wish to hold on to your product for longer than 2 weeks, you must come into the store on the day when your rental period ends and renew your rental.</p>
                <p> 3. You will usually be able to renew products, unless another customer has inquired about renting them. In that case, they will have been placed on hold, and you will have to return the item to the store. However, we will notify you as soon the next customer is finished with the item. </p>
                <p>4. No smoking is allowed inside the store. You may smoke outside if you wish.</p>
                <p>  5. If we see you trying to shoplift, you will receive a free ride in the back of a police car. </p>
                  <p>  6. Certain items' prices are negotiable. These items will be marked with a green sticker. If you wish to negotiate the price of an item, come up to the front desk and we will be happy to settle a deal with you. </p>
                <p> These are all of our main policies. They may seem a little overwhelming at first, but we here at Rad Records believe that they are necessary to keep our business running. We do not enjoy enforcing harsh policies on our customers, and only have them in place to ensure that Rad Records will be in operation for many, many more years, serving the community. <p>
